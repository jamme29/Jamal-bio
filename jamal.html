      <h3>Biograph</h3>
    <hr>
        <p> Masiko was born to Tommy Masiko and Sanyu Batambula in Uganda before the family relocated to Sweden when he was only 9 years old.

            While in Sweden, Masiko played for BK Kick, a local club in his area of residence before he joined Kulladals FF (also located in Malmo) a year later. </p>
            
            During his spell at Kulladals FF, the young winger bemoans a career-threatening knee injury he sustained which kept him out of action for close to 2 years  including the recovery period.</p>
            
            After a full recovery, Masiko moved to trelleborgs ff in the Sweden superettan and took action for the u16.

            Later on Masiko was realesed from Trelleborgs FF as coaches belived his quality did not meet the certain level needed. </p>

            As per Trelleborg Masiko joined the local side Fc Trelleborg where he took part of the u19 squad that later on went on and qualified for the second highest league for their Age, during his spell at Fc Trelleborg Masiko caught a reputition of being called "mbappe with dreads" mainly becuase of his trickyness, speed and flair in his game. </p>

            During his last spell, Fc trelleborg where losing 1-0 away from home and Masiko was on the bench, fact being he had played with the first team the day before. After 70 minutes of Jamal being on the bench Coach "Anders Ek" decided to bring in Masiko against the well playing Kvarnby, only for Masiko to come in and take his man on and get a penalty.</p>
            
            Jamal knew his role in the team and let his teammate score the penalty. The score was 1-1. as the game went on Jamal came on the right flank got passed his man and scored the winner. This perfomance caught the eye for the Ugandan national team youth scout, who had been eying Masiko throughout the season.</p>
            
            To elevate his value on the market Masiko was offered trial in France second division, with everything setup and planned all that was left was for Masiko was to park his bags and travel to France.</p>

           <p> But then came covid-19 

            Masiko was left with the option to stay with the division 2 side KSF Prespa Birlik.
            
            KSF Prespa Birlik currently lies on the Western Gotaland Group table of the Sweden Division 2. which is the fourth tier in the country’s football pyramid. </p>
       
           <p> During his spell at prespa Masiko failed to live up to expetaticions as he only managed to find the net 4 times in 24 games assisting 6. as his numbers declained. This later on led to him being sacked from Prespa birlik.</p>
            
           <p> For Statistics this was bad. but as for perfomance Masiko was always a stand out player in his team. As he caught the eye of a Danish coach that later on offered him a trial in the danish third tier side, where masiko went on and exelled his game for the rest of 2021.</p>

            - <p>Before going on to Denmark Masiko exsitted a spell at a local club called FC bellevue where he held himself inform with heavly experienced coaches such as Erol Bekir and Caspar Pauckstadt.</p>

            <p>Masiko noticed the huge differences between Swedish football and Danish, the intesity was imaquatley high.
            This led to Masiko improving more. And it showed as for when Masiko netted 12 goals and 9 assits in 30 games for the side. </p>
